# less-light-theme
Emacs theme: light colors and less syntax highlighting. Mid-00s throwback energy.

Inspired by [Greymatters](https://github.com/mswift42/greymatters-theme), [Codeschool](https://github.com/blockloop/vim-codeschool), and [Alabaster](https://github.com/tonsky/sublime-scheme-alabaster)
